“Why do we decide to use Kotlin in our projects instead of Java, JavaScript or C++? Developers are often bought by conciseness or amazing Kotlin features. For business, as I found out, the truly convincing argument is Kotlin safety - how its design eliminates potential application errors. You don’t need to have any experience with development to get upset when the application you use crashes, or when there is an error on a website that does not let you check out after you spent an hour collecting products into a basket. Having fewer crashes makes the lives of both users and developers better, and it provides significant business value.

Safety is important for us, and Kotlin is a really safe language, but it still needs developer support to be truly safe. In this chapter, we’ll talk about the most important best practices for safety in Kotlin. We’ll see how Kotlin features promote safety, and how we can use them properly. The general purpose of every item in this chapter is to produce code that is less prone to errors.”
