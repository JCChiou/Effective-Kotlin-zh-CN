Safety/Introduction.html":{"url":"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Introduction.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"“Why do we decide to use Kotlin in our projects instead of Java, JavaScript or C++? Developers are often bought by conciseness or amazing Kotlin features. For business, as I found out, the truly convincing argument is Kotlin safety - how its design eliminates potential application errors. You don’t need to have any experience with development to get upset when the application you use crashes, or when there is an error on a website that does not let you check out after you spent an hour collecting products into a basket. Having fewer crashes makes the lives of both users and developers better, and it provides significant business value.\nSafety is important for us, and Kotlin is a really safe language, but it still needs developer support to be truly safe. In this chapter, we’ll talk about the most important best practices for safety in Kotlin. We’ll see how Kotlin features promote safety, and how we can use them properly. The general purpose of every item in this chapter is to produce code that is less prone to errors.”\n"},"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 1 Limit mutability.html":{"url":"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 1 Limit mutability.html","title":"Item 1 Limit Mutability","keywords":"","body":"In Kotlin, we design programs in modules and each of them is composed of different kinds of elements such as classes, objects, functions, type aliases and top-level properties. Some of those elements can hold state, for instance by having read-write property var or by composing a mutable object:\nvar a = 10\nval list: MutableList = mutableListOf()\n\nWhen an element holds state, the way it behaves depends not only on how you use it, but also on its history. A typical example of a class with a state is a bank account that has some money balance:\n class BankAccount {\n    var balance = 0.0\n       private set\n\n    fun deposit(depositAmount: Double) {\n        balance += depositAmount\n    }\n\n    @Throws(InsufficientFunds::class)\n    fun withdraw(withdrawAmount: Double) {\n        if (balance \nHere BankAccount has a state that represents how much money is present on that account. Holding state is a double-edged sword. On one hand it is very useful because it makes it possible to represent elements changing over time, but on the other hand state management is hard, because:\n\nIt is harder to understand and debug a program with many mutating points. The relationship between these mutations needs to be understood, and it is harder to track how they changed when there are more of them. A class with many mutating points that depend on each other is often really hard to understand and to modify. It is especially problematic in case of unexpected situations or errors.\n\nMutability makes it harder to reason about the code. State of immutable element is clear. Mutable state is much harder to comprehend. It is harder to reason what is its value as it might change at any point and just because we checked in some moment it doesn’t mean it is still the same.\n\nIt requires proper synchronization in multithreaded programs.Every mutation is a potential conflict.\n\nMutable elements are harder to test. We need to test every possible state, and the more mutability, the more states there are to test. What is more, the number of states we need to test generally grows exponentially with the number of mutation points in the same object or file, as we need to test all different combinations of possible states.\n\nWhen state mutates, often some other classes need to be notified about this change. For instance, when we add a mutable element to a sorted list, once the element is changed, we need to sort this list again.\n\nProblems with state consistency and the growing complexity of the project with more mutation points are familiar for developers working in bigger teams. Let’s see an example of how hard it is to manage shared state. Take a look at the below snippet⁶. It shows multiple threads trying to modify the same property, however because of conflicts some of those operations will be lost.\n var num = 0\n for (i in 1..1000) {\n    thread {\n        Thread.sleep(10)\n        num += 1\n    }\n }\n Thread.sleep(5000)\n print(num) // Very unlikely to be 1000\n // Every time a different number\n\nWhen we use Kotlin coroutines, there are less conflicts because less threads are involved, but they still occur:\nsuspend fun main() {\n    var num = 0\n    coroutineScope {\n        for (i in 1..1000) {\n            launch {\n                delay(10)\n                num += 1\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    print(num) // Every time a different number\n}\n\nIn real-life projects, we generally cannot just lose some operations, and so we need to implement proper synchronization like the one presented below. Although implementing proper synchronization is hard, and the more mutation points we have, the harder it is. Limiting mutability does help.\n val lock = Any()\n var num = 0\n for (i in 1..1000) {\n    thread {\n        Thread.sleep(10)\n        synchronized(lock) {\n            num += 1\n        }\n    }\n }\n Thread.sleep(1000)\n print(num) // 1000\n\nThe drawbacks of mutability are so numerous that there are languages that do not allow state mutation at all. These are purely functional languages. One well-known example is Haskell. Such languages are rarely used for mainstream development though, since it’s very hard to do programming with so limited mutability. Mutating state is a very useful way to represent the state of real-world systems. I recommend using mutability, but do it sparingly and wisely decide where our mutating points should be. The good news is that Kotlin supports limiting mutability well.\nLimiting mutability in Kotlin\nKotlin is designed to support limiting mutability. It is easy to make immutable objects or to keep properties immutable. It is a result of many features and characteristics of this language, but the most important ones are:\n\nRead-only properties val\n\nSeparation between mutable and read-only collections\n\ncopy in data classes\n\n\nLet’s discuss them one by one.\nRead-only properties val\nIn Kotlin we can make each property read-only val (like value) or read-write var (like variable). Read-only properties val do not allow setting:\nval a = 10\na = 20 // ERROR\n\nNotice though that read-only properties are not necessarily immutable nor final. A read-only property can hold a mutable object:\nval list = mutableListOf(1,2,3) \nlist.add(4)\n\nprint(list) // [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nA read-only property can also be defined using a custom getter that might depend on another property:\nvar name: String = \"Marcin\"\nvar surname: String = \"Moskała\"\nval fullName \n    get() = \"$name $surname\"\n\nfun main() {\n   println(fullName) // Marcin Moskała\n   name = \"Maja\"\n   println(fullName) // Maja Moskała\n}\n\nNotice that it is possible because when we define a custom getter, it will be called every time we ask for the value.\n fun calculate(): Int {\n    print(\"Calculating... \")\n    return 42\n }\n\n val fizz = calculate() // Calculating...\n val buzz\n    get() = calculate()\n\n fun main() {\n    print(fizz) // 42\n    print(fizz) // 42\n    print(buzz) // Calculating... 42\n    print(buzz) // Calculating... 42\n }\n\nThis trait, that properties in Kotlin are encapsulated by default and they can have custom accessors (getters and setters) is very important in Kotlin because it gives us flexibility when we change or define our API. It will be described in detail in Item 16: Properties should represent state, not behavior. The core idea though is that val do not offer mutation points because it is only a getter under the hood when var is both getter and setter. That’s why we can override val with var:\ninterface Element {\n   val active: Boolean\n}\n\nclass ActualElement: Element {\n   override var active: Boolean = false\n}\n\nValues of read-only properties val can change, but such properties do not offer a mutation point which is the main source of problems when we need to synchronize or reason about a program. This is why we generally prefer val over var.\nAlthough remember that val doesn’t mean immutable. It can be defined by getter or delegate. This fact gives us more freedom to change. Though when we don’t need that, final properties should be preferred. It is easier to reason about them as they have the state stated next to their definition. They are also better supported in Kotlin. For instance, they can be smart-casted:\nval name: String? = \"Márton\"\nval surname: String = \"Braun\"\n\nval fullName: String?\n   get() = name?.let { \"$it $surname\" }\n\nval fullName2: String? = name?.let { \"$it $surname\" }\n\nfun main() {\n   if (fullName != null) {\n       println(fullName.length) // ERROR\n   }\n\n   if (fullName2 != null) {\n       println(fullName2.length) // Márton Braun\n   }\n}\n\nSmart cast is impossible for fullName because it is defined using getter, so it might give a different value during check and different later during use (for instance, if some other thread would set name). Non-local properties can be smart-casted only when they are final and do not have custom getter.\nSeparation between mutable and read-only collections\nSimilarly, as Kotlin separates read-write and read-only properties, Kotlin separates read-write and read-only collections. This is achieved thanks to the way the hierarchy of collections was designed. Take a look at the diagram presenting collections hierarchy in Kotlin. On the left side, you can see the Iterable, Collection, Set, and List interfaces that are read-only. This means that they do not have any methods that would allow modification. On the right side, you can see the MutableIterable, MutableCollection, MutableSet, and MutableList interfaces that represent mutable collections. Notice that each mutable interface extends the corresponding read-only interface, and adds methods that allow mutation. This is similar to how properties work. A read-only property means just a getter, while a read-write property means both a getter and a setter.\n\nRead-only collections are not necessarily immutable. Very often they are mutable, but they cannot be mutated because they are hidden behind read-only interfaces. For instance, the Iterable.map and Iterable.filter functions return ArrayList, which is a mutable list, as a List, which is a read-only interface. In the below snippet you can see a simplified implementation of Iterable.map from stdlib.\ninline fun  Iterable.map(\n   transformation: (T) -> R\n): List {\n   val list = ArrayList()\n   for (elem in this) {\n       list.add(transformation(elem))\n   }\n   return list\n}\n\nThe design choice to make these collection interfaces read-only instead of truly immutable is very important. It gives us much more freedom. Under the hood, any actual collection can be returned as long as it satisfies the interface. Therefore, we can use platform-specific collections.\nThe safety of this approach is close to the one achieved from having immutable collections. The only risk is when a developer tries to “hack the system” and performs down-casting. This is something that should never be allowed in Kotlin projects. We should be able to trust that when we return a list as read-only, it will be used only to read it. This is part of the contract. More about it on Part 2 of this book.\nDown-casting collections is not only breaking their contract and depending on implementation instead of abstraction as we should, but it is also insecure and can lead to surprising consequences. Take a look at this code:\nval list = listOf(1,2,3)\n\n// DON’T DO THIS!\nif (list is MutableList) {\n   list.add(4)\n}\n\nThe result of this operation is platform-specific. On the JVM listOf returns an instance of Arrays.ArrayList that implements Java List interface. This Java List interface has methods like add or set, and so it translates to the Kotlin MutableList interface. However, Arrays.ArrayList does not implement some of those operations. This is why the result of the above code is the following:\nException in thread “main” java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException\nat java.util.AbstractList.add(AbstractList.java:148)\nat java.util.AbstractList.add(AbstractList.java:108)\n\nThough there is no guarantee how this will behave in a year from now. Underlying collections might change. They might be replaced with truly immutable collections implemented in Kotlin and not implementing MutableList at all. Nothing is guaranteed. This is why down-casting read-only collections to mutable should never take place in Kotlin. If you need to change from read-only to mutable, you should use List.toMutableList function, which creates a copy that you can then modify:\nval list = listOf(1, 2, 3)\n\nval mutableList = list.toMutableList()\nmutableList.add(4)\n\nThis way does not break any contract, and it is also safer for us as we can feel safe that when we expose something as List it won’t be modified from outside.\nCopy in data classes\nThere are many reasons to prefer immutable objects - objects that do not change their internal state, like String or Int. In addition to the already named reasons why we generally prefer less mutability, immutable objects have their own advantages:\n\nThey are easier to reason about since their state stays the same once they are created.\nImmutability makes it easier to parallelize the program as there are no conflicts among shared objects.\nReferences to immutable objects can be cached as they are not going to change.\nWe do not need to make defensive copies on immutable objects. When we do copy immutable objects, we do not need to make it a deep copy.\nImmutable objects are the perfect material to construct other objects. Both mutable and immutable. We can still decide where mutability takes place, and it is easier to operate on immutable objects.\nWe can add them to set or use them as keys in maps, in opposition to mutable objects that shouldn’t be used this way. This is because both those collections use hash table under the hood in Kotlin/JVM, and when we modify elements already classified to a hash table, its classification might not be correct anymore and we won’t be able to find it. This problem will be described in detail in Item 41: Respect the contract of hashCode. We have a similar issue when a collection is sorted.\n\nval names: SortedSet = TreeSet()\nval person = FullName(\"AAA\", \"AAA\")\nnames.add(person)\nnames.add(FullName(\"Jordan\", \"Hansen\"))\nnames.add(FullName(\"David\", \"Blanc\"))\n\nprint(s) // [AAA AAA, David Blanc, Jordan Hansen]\nprint(person in names) // true\n\nperson.name = \"ZZZ\"\nprint(names) // [ZZZ AAA, David Blanc, Jordan Hansen]\nprint(person in names) // false”\n\nAt the last check, collection returned false even though that person is in this set. It couldn’t be found because it is in an incorrect position.\nAs you can see, mutable objects are more dangerous and less predictable. On the other hand, the biggest problem of immutable objects is that data sometimes needs to change. The solution is that the immutable objects should have methods that produce an object after some change. For instance, Int is immutable, and it has many methods like plus or minus that do not modify it but instead return a new Int after this operation. Iterable is read-only, and collection processing functions like map or filter do not modify it, but instead return a new collection. The same can be applied to our immutable objects. For instance, let’s say that we have an immutable class User and we need to allow its surname to change. We can support it with a withSurname method that produces a copy with a particular property changed:\nclass User(\n   val name: String,\n   val surname: String\n) {\n   fun withSurname(surname: String) = User(name, surname)\n}\n\nvar user = User(\"Maja\", \"Markiewicz\")\nuser = user.withSurname(\"Moskała\")\nprint(user) // User(name=Maja, surname=Moskała)\n\nWriting such functions is possible, but also tedious if we need one for every property. Here comes the data modifier to the rescue. One of the methods it generates is copy. It creates a new instance where all primary constructor properties are the same as in the previous one by default. New values can be specified as well. copy together with other methods generated by data modifier are described in detail in Item 37: Use data modifier to represent a bundle of data. Here is a simple example showing how it works:\ndata class User(\n   val name: String,\n   val surname: String\n)\n\nvar user = User(\"Maja\", \"Markiewicz\")\nuser = user.copy(surname = \"Moskała\")\nprint(user) // User(name=Maja, surname=Moskała)\n\nThis is an elegant and universal solution that supports making data model classes immutable. Surely, this way is less efficient than just using a mutable object instead, but it has all described advantages of immutable objects and should be preferred by default.\nDifferent kinds of mutation points\nLet’s say that we need to represent a mutating list. There are two ways we can achieve that. Either by using a mutable collection or by using read-write property var:\nval list1: MutableList = mutableListOf() \nvar list2: List = listOf()\n\nBoth properties can be modified, but in different ways:\nlist1.add(1) \nlist2 = list2 + 1\n\nBoth of these ways can be replaced with the plus-assign operator as well, but each of them is translated into a different behavior:\nlist1 += 1 // Translates to list1.plusAssign(1) \nlist2 += 1 // Translates to list2 = list2.plus(1)\n\nBoth those ways are correct and they both have their pros and cons. They both have a single mutating point, but it is located in a different place. In the first one mutation takes place on the concrete list implementation. We might depend on the fact that it has proper synchronization in case of multithreading, but such an assumption is also dangerous since it is not really guaranteed. In the second one, we need to implement the synchronization ourselves, but the overall safety is better because the mutating point is only a single property. Though, in case of a lack of synchronization, remember that we can still lose some elements:\nar list = listOf()\nfor (i in 1..1000) {\n   thread {\n       list = list + i\n   }\n}\nThread.sleep(1000)\nprint(list.size) // Very unlikely to be 1000, \n// every time a different number, like for instance 911\n\nUsing a mutable property instead of a mutable list allows us to track how this property changes when we define a custom setter or using a delegate (which is using a custom setter). For instance, when we use an observable delegate, we can log every change of a list:\nvar names by Delegates.observable(listOf()) { _, old, new ->\n   println(\"Names changed from $old to $new\")\n}\n\nnames += \"Fabio\" \n// Names changed from [] to [Fabio]\nnames += \"Bill\"   \n// Names changed from [Fabio] to [Fabio, Bill]”\n\nTo make this possible for a mutable collection, we would need a special observable implementation of the collection. For read-only collections on mutable properties, it is also easier to control how they change - there is only a setter instead of multiple methods mutating this object, and we can make it private:\nvar announcements = listOf()\n   private set\n\nIn short, using mutable collections is a slightly faster option, but using a mutable property instead gives us more control over how the object is changing.\nNotice that the worst solution is to have both a mutating property and a mutable collection:\n// Don’t do that\nvar list3 = mutableListOf()\n\nWe would need to synchronize both ways it can mutate (by property change and by internal state change). Also, changing it using plus-assign is impossible because of ambiguity:\n\nThe general rule is that one should not create unnecessary ways to mutate state. Every way to mutate state is a cost. It needs to be understood and maintained. We prefer to limit mutability.\nDo not leak mutation points\nIt is an especially dangerous situation when we expose a mutable object that makes up state. Take a look at this example:\ndata class User(val name: String)\n\nclass UserRepository {\n   private val storedUsers: MutableMap = \n       mutableMapOf()\n\n   fun loadAll(): MutableMap {\n       return storedUsers\n   }\n\n   //...\n}\n\nOne could use loadAll to modify UserRepository private state:\nval userRepository = UserRepository()\n\nval storedUsers = userRepository.loadAll()\nstoredUsers[4] = \"Kirill\"\n//...\n\nprint(userRepository.loadAll()) // {4=Kirill}\n\nIt is especially dangerous when such modifications are accidental. There are two ways how we can deal with that. The first one is copying returned mutable objects. We call that defensive copying. This can be a useful technique when we deal with a standard objects and here copy generated by data modifier can be really helpful:\nclass UserHolder {\n    private val user: MutableUser()\n\n    fun get(): MutableUser {\n        return user.copy()\n    }\n\n    //...\n}\n\nThough whenever possible we prefer limiting mutability, and for collections we can do that by upcasting those objects to their read-only supertype:\ndata class User(val name: String)\n\nclass UserRepository {\n   private val storedUsers: MutableMap = \n       mutableMapOf()\n\n   fun loadAll(): Map {\n       return storedUsers\n   }\n\n   //...\n}\n\nSummary\nIn this chapter we’ve learned why it is important to limit mutability and to prefer immutable objects. We’ve seen that Kotlin gives us a lot of tools that support limiting mutability. We should use them to limit mutation points. Simple rules are:\n\nPrefer val over var.\nPrefer an immutable property over a mutable one.\nPrefer objects and classes that are immutable over mutable.\nIf you need them to change, consider making them immutable data classes, and using copy.\nWhen you hold state, prefer read-only over mutable collections.\nDesign your mutation points wisely and do not produce unnecessary ones.\nDo not expose mutable objects.\n\nThere are some exceptions to these rules. Sometimes we prefer a mutable object because they are more efficient. Such optimizations should be preferred only in the performance critical parts of our code (Part 3: Efficiency) and when we use them, we need to remember that mutability requires more attention when we prepare it for multithreading. The baseline is that we should limit mutability.\n"},"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 2 Minimize the scope of variables.html":{"url":"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 2 Minimize the scope of variables.html","title":"Item 2 Minimize The Scope Of Variables","keywords":"","body":"When we define a state, we prefer to tighten the scope of variables and properties by:\n\nUsing local variables instead of properties\nUsing variables in the narrowest scope possible, so for instance, if a variable is used only inside a loop, defining it inside this loop\n\nThe scope of an element is the region of a computer program where the element is visible. In Kotlin, the scope is nearly always created by curly braces, and we can generally access elements from the outer scope. Take a look at this example:\nval a = 1\nfun fizz() {\n   val b = 2\n   print(a + b)\n}\nval buzz = {\n   val c = 3\n   print(a + c)\n}\n// Here we can see a, but not b nor c\n\nIn the above example, in the scope of the functions fizz and buzz, we can access variables from the outer scope. However, in the outer scope, we cannot access variables defined in those functions. Here is an example of how limiting variable scope might look like:\n// Bad\nvar user: User\nfor (i in users.indices) {\n   user = users[i]\n   print(\"User at $i is $user\")\n}\n\n// Better\nfor (i in users.indices) {\n   val user = users[i]\n   print(\"User at $i is $user\")\n}\n\n// Same variables scope, nicer syntax\nfor ((i, user) in users.withIndex()) {\n   print(\"User at $i is $user\")\n}\n\nIn the first example, the user variable is accessible not only in the scope of the for-loop, but also outside of it. In the second and third examples, we limit the scope of the user variable concretely to the scope of the for-loop.\nSimilarly, we might have many scopes inside scopes (most likely created by lambda expressions inside lambda expressions), and it is better to define variables in as narrow scope as possible.\nThere are many reasons why we prefer it this way, but the most important one is: When we tighten a variable’s scope, it is easier to keep our programs simple to track and manage. When we analyze code, we need to think about what elements are there at this point. The more elements there are to deal with, the harder it is to do programming. The simpler your application is, the less likely it will be to break. This is a similar reason to why we prefer immutable properties or objects over their mutable counterparts.\nThinking about mutable properties, it is easier to track how they change when they can only be modified in a smaller scope. It is easier to reason about them and change their behavior.\nAnother problem is that variables with a wider scope might be overused by another developer. For instance, one could reason that if a variable is used to assign the next elements in an iteration, the last element in the list should remain in that variable once the loop is complete. Such reasoning could lead to terrible abuse, like using this variable after the iteration to do something with the last element. It would be really bad because another developer trying to understand what value is there would need to understand the whole reasoning. This would be a needless complication.\nWhether a variable is read-only or read-write, we always prefer a variable to be initialized when it is defined. Do not force a developer to look where it was defined. This can be supported with control structures such as if, when, try-catch or the Elvis operator used as expressions:\n // Bad\nval user: User\nif (hasValue) {\n   user = getValue()\n} else {\n   user = User()\n}\n\n// Better\nval user: User = if(hasValue) {\n   getValue()\n} else {\n   User()\n}\n\nIf we need to set-up multiple properties, destructuring declarations can help us:\n// Bad\nfun updateWeather(degrees: Int) {\n   val description: String\n   val color: Int\n   if (degrees  \"cold\" to Color.BLUE\n       degrees  \"mild\" to Color.YELLOW\n       else -> \"hot\" to Color.RED\n   }\n   // ...\n}\n\nFinally, too wide variable scope can be dangerous. Let’s describe one common danger.\nCapturing\nWhen I teach about Kotlin coroutines, one of my exercises is to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers using a sequence builder. The algorithm is conceptually simple:\n\nWe take a list of numbers starting from 2.\n\nWe take the first one. It is a prime number.\n\nFrom the rest of the numbers, we remove the first one and we filter out all the numbers that are divisible by this prime number.\n\n\nA very simple implementation of this algorithm looks like this:\nvar numbers = (2..100).toList()\nval primes = mutableListOf()\nwhile (numbers.isNotEmpty()) {\n   val prime = numbers.first()\n   primes.add(prime)\n   numbers = numbers.filter { it % prime != 0 }\n}\nprint(primes) // [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, \n// 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]\n\nThe challenge is to let it produce a potentially infinite sequence of prime numbers. If you want to challenge yourself, stop now and try to implement it.\nThis is what the solution could look like:\nval primes: Sequence = sequence {\n   var numbers = generateSequence(2) { it + 1 }\n\n   while (true) {\n       val prime = numbers.first()\n       yield(prime)\n       numbers = numbers.drop(1)\n           .filter { it % prime != 0 }\n   }\n}\n\nprint(primes.take(10).toList()) \n// [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]\n\nAlthough in nearly every group there is a person who tries to “optimize” it, and to not create the variable in every loop he or she extracts prime as a mutable variable:\nval primes: Sequence = sequence {\n   var numbers = generateSequence(2) { it + 1 }\n\n   var prime: Int\n   while (true) {\n       prime = numbers.first()\n       yield(prime)\n       numbers = numbers.drop(1)\n           .filter { it % prime != 0 }\n   }\n}\n\nThe problem is that this implementation does not work correctly anymore. These are the first 10 yielded numbers:\nprint(primes.take(10).toList()) \n// [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\n\nStop now and try to explain this result.\nThe reason why we have such a result is that we captured the variable prime. Filtering is done lazily because we’re using a sequence. In every step, we add more and more filters. In the “optimized” one we always add the filter which references the mutable property prime. Therefore we always filter the last value of prime. This is why this filtering does not work properly. Only dropping works and so we end up with consecutive numbers (except for 4 which was filtered out when prime was still set to 2).\nWe should be aware of problems with unintentional capturing because such situations happen. To prevent them we should avoid mutability and prefer narrower scope for variables.\nSummary\nFor many reasons, we should prefer to define variables for the closest possible scope. Also, we prefer val over var also for local variables. We should always be aware of the fact that variables are captured in lambdas. These simple rules can save us a lot of trouble.\n"},"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 3 Eliminate platform types as soon as possible.html":{"url":"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 3 Eliminate platform types as soon as possible.html","title":"Item 3 Eliminate Platform Types As Soon As Possible","keywords":"","body":"The null-safety introduced by Kotlin is amazing. Java was known in the community from Null-Pointer Exceptions (NPE), and Kotlin’s safety mechanisms make them rare or eliminate them entirely. Although one thing that cannot be secured completely is a connection between a language that does not have solid null-safety - like Java or C - and Kotlin. Imagine that we use a Java method that declares String as a return type. What type should it be in Kotlin?\nIf it is annotated with the @Nullable annotation then we assume that it is nullable and we interpret it as a String?. If it is annotated with @NotNull then we trust this annotation and we type it as String. Though, what if this return type is not annotated with either of those annotations?\n// Java \npublic class JavaTest {\n    public String giveName() { \n          // ...\n    }\n}\n\nWe might say that then we should treat such a type as nullable. This would be a safe approach since in Java everything is nullable. However, we often know that something is not null so we would end up using the not-null assertion !! in many places all around our code.\nThe real problem would be when we would need to take generic types from Java. Imagine that a Java API returns a List that is not annotated at all. If Kotlin would assume nullable types by default, and we would know that this list and those users are not null, we would need to not only assert the whole list but also filter nulls:\n// Java \npublic class UserRepo {\n        public List getUsers() { \n          //*** \n    }\n}\n\n// Kotlin \nval users: List = UserRepo().users!!.filterNotNull()\n\nWhat if a function would return a List> instead?\nGets complicated:\nval users: List> = UserRepo().groupedUsers!!.map { it!!.filterNotNull() }\n\nLists at least have functions like map and filterNotNull. In other\ngeneric types, nullability would be an even bigger problem. This is why instead of being treated as nullable by default, a type that comes from Java and has unknown nullability is a special type in Kotlin. It is called a platform type.\nPlatform type - a type that comes from another language and has unknown nullability.\nPlatform types are notated with a single exclamation mark ! after the type name, such as String!. Though this notation cannot be used in a code. Platform types are non-denotable, meaning that one cannot write them down explicitly in the language. When a platform value is assigned to a Kotlin variable or property, it can be inferred but it cannot be explicitly set. Instead, we can choose the type that we expect: Either a nullable or a non-null type.\n// Java \npublic class UserRepo {\n    public User getUser() {\n            //...\n    } \n}\n\n// Kotlin \nval repo = UserRepo() \nval user1 = repo.user // Type of user1 is User! \nval user2: User = repo.user // Type of user2 is User \nval user3: User? = repo.user // Type of user3 is User?\n\nThanks to this fact, getting generic types from Java is not problematic:\nval users: List = UserRepo().users \nval users: List> = UserRepo().groupedUsers\n\nThe problem is that is still dangerous because something we assumed to be not-null might be null. This is why for safety reasons I always suggest to be very conscientious of when we get platform types from Java. Remember that even if a function does not return null now, that doesn’t mean that it won’t change in the future. If its designer hasn’t specified it by an annotation or by describing it in a comment, they can introduce this behavior without changing any contract.\nIf you have some control over Java code that needs to interoperate with Kotlin, introduce @Nullable and @NotNull annotations wherever possible.\n// Java \nimport org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull; \npublic class UserRepo {\n        public @NotNull User getUser() {\n                //...\n    } \n}\n\nThis is one of the most important steps when we want to support Kotlin developers well (and it’s also important information for Java developers). Annotating many exposed types was one of the most important changes that were introduced into the Android API after Kotlin became a first-class citizen. This made the Android API much more Kotlin-friendly.\nNote that many different kinds of annotations are supported, including those by:\n\nJetBrains (@Nullable and @NotNull from org.jetbrains.annotations)\n\nAndroid (@Nullable and @NonNull from androidx.annotation as well as from com.android.annotations and from the support library android.support.annotations)\n\nJSR-305 (@Nullable,@CheckForNull and @Nonnull from javax.annotation)\n\nJavaX (@Nullable, @CheckForNull, @Nonnull from javax.annotation)\n\nFindBugs (@Nullable, @CheckForNull, @PossiblyNull and @NonNull from edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations)\n\nReactiveX (@Nullable and @NonNull from io.reactivex.annotations)\n\nEclipse (@Nullable and @NonNull from org.eclipse.jdt.annotation)\n\nLombok (@NonNull from lombok)\n\n\nAlternatively, you can specify in Java that all types should be Notnull by default using JSR 305’s @ParametersAreNonnullByDefault annotation.\nThere is something we can do in our Kotlin code as well. My recommendation for safety reasons is to eliminate these platform types as soon as possible. To understand why, think about the difference between how statedType and platformType functions behave in this example:\n// Java \npublic class JavaClass {\n        public String getValue() {\n                return null;\n    } \n}\n\n// Kotlin \nfun statedType() {\n\n        val value: String = JavaClass().value\n\n        //...\n\n        println(value.length) \n}\n\nfun platformType() { \n      val value = JavaClass().value \n      //...\n      println(value.length) \n}\n\nIn both cases, a developer assumed that getValue will not return null and he or she was wrong. This results in an NPE in both cases, but there’s a difference in where that error happens.\nIn statedType the NPE will be thrown in the same line where we get the value from Java. It would be absolutely clear that we wrongly assumed a not-null type and we got null. We would just need to change it and adjust the rest of our code to this change.\nIn platformType the NPE will be thrown when we use this value as not-nullable. Possibly from a middle of some more complex expression. Variable typed as a platform type can be treated both as nullable and not-nullable. Such variable might be used few times safely, and then unsafely and throw NPE then. When we use such properties, typing system do not protect us. It is a similar situation as in Java, but in Koltin we do not expect that we might have NPE just from using an object. It is very likely that sooner or later someone will use it unsafely, and then we will end up with a runtime exception and its cause might be not so easy to find.\n// Java \npublic class JavaClass {\n        public String getValue() {\n                return null;\n    } \n}\n\n// Kotlin \nfun platformType() {\n        val value = JavaClass().value\n        //...\n        println(value.length) // NPE \n}\n\nfun statedType() { \n      val value: String = JavaClass().value // NPE \n      //...\n      println(value.length) \n}\n\nWhat is even more dangerous, platform type might be propagated further. For instance, we might expose a platform type as a part of our interface:\ninterface UserRepo { \n    fun getUserName() = JavaClass().value \n}\n\nIn this case, methods inferred type is a platform type. This means that anyone can still decide if it is nullable or not. One might choose to treat it as nullable in a definition site, and as a non-nullable in the use-site:\nclass RepoImpl: UserRepo {\n   override fun getUserName(): String? {\n       return null\n   }\n}\n\nfun main() {\n   val repo: UserRepo = RepoImpl()\n   val text: String = repo.getUserName() // NPE in runtime\n   print(\"User name length is ${text.length}\")\n}\n\nPropagating a platform type is a recipe for disaster. They are problematic, and for safety reasons, we should always eliminate them as soon as possible. In this case, IDEA IntelliJ helps us with a warning:\n\nSummary\nTypes that come from another language and has unknown nullability are known as platform types. Since they are dangerous, we should eliminate them as soon as possible, and do not let them propagate. It is also good to specify types using annotations that specify nullability on exposed Java constructors, methods and fields. It is precious information both for Java and Kotlin developers using those elements.\n"},"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 4 Do not expose inferred types.html":{"url":"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 4 Do not expose inferred types.html","title":"Item 4 Do Not Expose Inferred Types","keywords":"","body":"Kotlin’s type inference is one of the most popular Kotlin features in the JVM world. So popular that Java 10 introduced type inference as well (limited comparing to Kotlin). Though, there are some dangers in using this feature. Above all, we need to remember that the inferred type of an assignment is the exact type of the right side, and not a superclass or interface:\nopen class Animal\nclass Zebra: Animal()\n\nfun main() {\n   var animal = Zebra()\n   animal = Animal() // Error: Type mismatch\n}\n\nIn most cases, this is not a problem. When we have too restrictive type inferred, we just need to specify it and our problem is solved:\nopen class Animal\nclass Zebra: Animal()\n\nfun main() {\n   var animal: Animal = Zebra()\n   animal = Animal()\n}\n\nThough, there is no such comfort when we don’t control a library or another module. In such cases, inferred type exposition can be really dangerous. Let’s see an example. \nLet’s say that you have the following interface used to represent car factories:\n1 interface CarFactory {\n2    fun produce(): Car\n3 }\n\nThere is also a default car used if nothing else was specified:\n1 val DEFAULT_CAR: Car = Fiat126P()\n\nIt is produced in most factories, so you made it default. You omitted the type because you decided that DEFAULT_CAR is a Car anyway:\n1 interface CarFactory {\n2    fun produce() = DEFAULT_CAR\n3 }\n\nSimilarly, someone later looked at DEFAULT_CAR and decided that its type can be inferred:\n1 val DEFAULT_CAR = Fiat126P()\n\nNow, all your factories can only produce Fiat126P. Not good. If you defined this interface yourself, this problem will be probably caught soon and easily fixed. Though, if it is a part of the external API, you might be informed first by angry users.\nExcept that, the return type is important information when someone does not know API well, and so for the sake of readability, we should make it explicit especially in parts of our API visible from outside (so exposed API). \nSummary\nThe general rule is that if we are not sure about the type, we should specify it. It is important information and we should not hide it (Item 14: Specify the variable type when it is not clear). Additionally for the sake of safety, in an external API, we should always specify types. We cannot let them be changed by accident. Inferred types can be too restrictive or can too easily change when our project evolves.\n"},"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 5 Specify your expectations on arguments and state.html":{"url":"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 5 Specify your expectations on arguments and state.html","title":"Item 5 Specify Your Expectations On Arguments And State","keywords":"","body":"Item 5: Specify your expectations on arguments and state\nWhen you have expectations, declare them as soon as possible. We do that in Kotlin mainly using:\n\nrequire block - a universal way to specify expectations on arguments.\ncheck block - a universal way to specify expectations on the state.\nassert block - a universal way to check if something is true. Such checks on the JVM will be evaluated only on the testing mode.\nElvis operator with return or throw.\n\nHere is an example using those mechanisms:\n// Part of Stack\nfun pop(num: Int = 1): List {\n   require(num \nSpecifying experiences this way does not free us from the necessity to specify those expectations in the documentation, but it is really helpful anyway. Such declarative checks have many advantages:\n\nExpectations are visible even to those programmers who are not reading the documentation.\nIf they are not satisfied, the function throws an exception instead of leading to unexpected behavior. It is important that these exceptions are thrown before the state is modified and so we will not have a situation where only some modifications are applied and others are not. Such situations are dangerous and hard to manage4. Thanks to assertive checks, errors are harder to miss and our state is more stable.\nCode is to some degree self-checking. There is less of a need to be unit-tested when these conditions are checked in the code.\nAll checks listed above work with smart-casting, so thanks to them there is less casting required.\n\nLet’s talk about different kinds of checks, and why we need them. Starting from the most popular one: the arguments check.\nArguments\nWhen you define a function with arguments, it is not uncommon to have some expectations on those arguments that cannot be expressed using the type system. Just take a look at a few examples:\n\nWhen you calculate the factorial of a number, you might require this number to be a positive integer.\nWhen you look for clusters, you might require a list of points to not be empty.\nWhen you send an email to a user you might require that user to have an email, and this value to be a correct email address (assuming that user should check email correctness before using this function).\n\nThe most universal and direct Kotlin way to state those requirements is using the require function that checks this requirement and throws an exception if it is not satisfied:\nfun factorial(n: Int): Long {\n   require(n >= 0)\n   return if (n ): List {\n   require(points.isNotEmpty())\n   //...\n}\n\nfun sendEmail(user: User, message: String) {\n   requireNotNull(user.email)\n   require(isValidEmail(user.email))\n   //...\n}\n\nNotice that these requirements are highly visible thanks to the fact they are declared at the very beginning of the functions. This makes them clear for the user reading those functions (though the requirements should be stated in documentation as well because not everyone reads function bodies).\nThose expectations cannot be ignored, because the require function throws an\nIllegalArgumentException when the predicate is not satisfied. When such a block is placed at the beginning of the function we know that if an argument is incorrect, the function will stop immediately and the user won’t miss it. The exception will be clear in opposition to the potentially strange result that might propagate far until it fails. In other words, when we properly specify our expectations on arguments at the beginning of the function, we can then assume that those expectations will be satisfied.\nWe can also specify a lazy message for this exception in a lambda expression after the call:\nfun factorial(n: Int): Long {\n   require(n >= 0) { \"Cannot calculate factorial of $n \" +\n\"because it is smaller than 0\" }\n   return if (n \nThe require function is used when we specify requirements on arguments.\nAnother common case is when we have expectations on the current state, and in such a case, we can use the check function instead.\nState\nIt is not uncommon that we only allow using some functions in concrete conditions. A few common examples:\n\nSome functions might need an object to be initialized first.\nActions might be allowed only if the user is logged in.\nFunctions might require an object to be open.\n\nThe standard way to check if those expectations on the state are satisfied is to use the check function:\nfun speak(text: String) {\n   check(isInitialized)\n   //...\n}\n\nfun getUserInfo(): UserInfo {\n   checkNotNull(token)\n   //...\n}\n\nfun next(): T {\n   check(isOpen)\n   //...\n}\n\nThe check function works similarly to require, but it throws an IllegalStateException when the stated expectation is not met. It checks if a state is correct. The exception message can be customized using a lazy message, just like with require. When the expectation is on the whole function, we place it at the beginning, generally after the require blocks. Although some state expectations are local, and check can be used later.\nWe use such checks especially when we suspect that a user might break our contract and call the function when it should not be called. Instead of trusting that they won’t do that, it is better to check and throw an appropriate exception. We might also use it when we do not trust that our own implementation handles the state correctly. Although for such cases, when we are checking mainly for the sake of testing our own implementation, we have another function called assert.\nAssertions\nThere are things we know to be true when a function is implemented correctly. For instance, when a function is asked to return 10 elements we might expect that it will return 10 elements. This is something we expect to be true, but it doesn’t mean we are always right. We all make mistakes. Maybe we made a mistake in the implementation. Maybe someone changed a function we used and our function does not work properly anymore. Maybe our function does not work correctly anymore because it was refactored. For all those problems the most universal solution is that we should write unit tests that check if our expectations match reality:\nclass StackTest {\n\n   @Test\n   fun `Stack pops correct number of elements`() {\n       val stack = Stack(20) { it }\n       val ret = stack.pop(10)\n       assertEquals(10, ret.size)\n   }\n\n   //...\n}\n\nUnit tests should be our most basic way to check implementation correctness but notice here that the fact that popped list size matches the desired one is rather universal to this function. It would be useful to add such a check in nearly every pop call. Having only a single check for this single use is rather naive because there might be some edge-cases. A better solution is to include the assertion in the function:\nfun pop(num: Int = 1): List {\n   //...\n   assert(ret.size == num)\n   return ret\n}\n\nSuch conditions are currently enabled only in Kotlin/JVM, and they are not checked unless they are enabled using the -ea JVM option. We should rather treat them as part of unit tests - they check if our code works as expected. By default, they are not throwing any errors in production. They are enabled by default only when we run tests. This is generally desired because if we made an error, we might rather hope that the user won’t notice. If this is a serious error that is probable and might have significant consequences, use check instead. The main advantages of having assert checks in functions instead of in unit tests are:\n\nAssertions make code self-checking and lead to more effective testing.\nExpectations are checked for every real use-case instead of for concrete cases.\nWe can use them to check something at the exact point of execution.\nWe make code fail early, closer to the actual problem. Thanks to that we can also easily find where and when the unexpected behavior started.\n\nJust remember that for them to be used, we still need to write unit tests. In a standard application run, assert will not throw any exceptions.\nSuch assertions are a common practice in Python. Not so much in Java. In Kotlin feel free to use them to make your code more reliable.\nNullability and smart casting\nBoth require and check have Kotlin contracts that state that when the function returns, its predicate is true after this check.\npublic inline fun require(value: Boolean): Unit {\n   contract {\n       returns() implies value\n   }\n   require(value) { \"Failed requirement.\" }\n}\n\nEverything that is checked in those blocks will be treated as true later in the same function. This works well with smart casting because once we check if something is true, the compiler will treat it so. In the below example we require a person’s outfit to be a Dress. After that, assuming that the outfit property is final, it will be smart cast to Dress.\nfun changeDress(person: Person) {\n   require(person.outfit is Dress)\n   val dress: Dress = person.outfit\n   //...\n}\n\nThis characteristic is especially useful when we check if something is null:\nclass Person(val email: String?)\n\nfun sendEmail(person: Person, message: String) {\n   require(person.email != null)\n   val email: String = person.email\n   //...\n}\n\nFor such cases, we even have special functions: requireNotNull and checkNotNull. They both have the capability to smart cast variables, and they can also be used as expressions to “unpack” it:\nclass Person(val email: String?)\nfun validateEmail(email: String) { /*...*/ }\n\nfun sendEmail(person: Person, text: String) {\n   val email = requireNotNull(person.email)\n   validateEmail(email)\n   //...\n}\n\nfun sendEmail(person: Person, text: String) {\n   requireNotNull(person.email)\n   validateEmail(person.email)\n   //...\n}\n\nFor nullability, it is also popular to use the Elvis operator with throw or return on the right side. Such a structure is also highly readable and at the same time, it gives us more flexibility in deciding what behavior we want to achieve. First of all, we can easily stop a function using return instead of throwing an error:\nfun sendEmail(person: Person, text: String) {\n   val email: String = person.email ?: return\n   //...\n}\n\nIf we need to make more than one action if a property is incorrectly null, we can always add them by wrapping return or throw into the run function. Such a capability might be useful if we would need to log why the function was stopped:\nfun sendEmail(person: Person, text: String) {\n   val email: String = person.email ?: run {\n       log(\"Email not sent, no email address\")\n       return\n   }\n   //...\n}\n\nThe Elvis operator with return or throw is a popular and idiomatic way to specify what should happen in case of variable nullability and we should not hesitate to use it. Again, if it is possible, keep such checks at the beginning of the function to make them visible and clear.\nSummary\nSpecify your expectations to:\n\nMake them more visible.\nProtect your application stability.\nProtect your code correctness.\nSmart cast variables.\n\nFour main mechanisms we use for that are:\n\nrequire block - a universal way to specify expectations on arguments.\ncheck block - a universal way to specify expectations on the state.\nassert block - a universal way to test in testing mode if something is true.\nElvis operator with return or throw.\n\nYou might also use throw to throw a different error.\n"},"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 6 Prefer standard errors to custom ones.html":{"url":"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 6 Prefer standard errors to custom ones.html","title":"Item 6 Prefer Standard Errors To Custom Ones","keywords":"","body":"Item 6: Prefer standard errors to custom ones\nFunctions require, check and assert cover the most common Kotlin errors, but there are also other kinds of unexpected situations we need to indicate. For instance, when you implement a library to parse the JSON format, it is reasonable to throw a JsonParsingException when the provided JSON file does not have the correct format:\ninline fun  String.readObject(): T {\n   //...\n   if (incorrectSign) {\n       throw JsonParsingException()\n   }\n   //...\n   return result\n}\n\nHere we used a custom error because there is no suitable error in the standard library to indicate that situation. Whenever possible, you should use exceptions from the standard library instead of defining your own. Such exceptions are known by developers and they should be reused. Reusing known elements with well-established contracts makes your API easier to learn and to understand. Here is the list of some of the most common exceptions you can use:\n\nIllegalArgumentException and IllegalStateException that we throw using require and check as described in Item 5: Specify your expectations on arguments and state.\nIndexOutOfBoundsException - Indicate that the index parameter value is out of range. Used especially by collections and arrays. It is thrown for instance by ArrayList.get(Int).\nConcurrentModificationException - Indicate that concurrent modification is prohibited and yet it has been detected. \nUnsupportedOperationException - Indicate that the declared method is not supported by the object. Such a situation should be avoided and when a method is not supported, it should not be present in the class. \nNoSuchElementException - Indicate that the element being requested does not exist. Used for instance when we implement Iterable and the client asks for next when there are no more elements.\n\n"},"Part 1 Good code/Chapter 1 Safety/Item 7 Prefer null or Failure result when the lack
